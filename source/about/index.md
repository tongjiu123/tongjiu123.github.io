### Work Experience

- **Peking University Wuhan AI Research Institute** — LLM & Agent Researcher *(10/2025 – Present)*
  - Led supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of government domain LLMs based on DeepSeek-70B and Qwen3-32B. Achieved 26% improvement in structured output quality (content compliance scoring 9.90/10).
  - Designed and deployed the JiangXia community intelligent agent system using a 1+3+5+N multi-agent architecture with RAG and local knowledge base.
  - Built a complete validation pipeline for virtual digital humans covering asset creation, motion driving, and delivery.
  - Developed a dual-agent system (learning companion + AI teaching assistant) using Baidu Qianfan AppBuilder with web search and textbook-based RAG.

- **TG0 Ltd.** — AI Intern, SWEET Team, London, UK *(05/2025 – 09/2025)*
  - Developed a 3D human pose estimation pipeline by fusing MediaPipe 2D keypoints with RealSense RGB-D and IMU data, using SVD-based rigid transformation for multi-view alignment.
  - Developed a deep learning motion capture system converting MediaPipe 3D keypoints to Rokoko joint angles, evolving from basic MLP to bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanisms, achieving joint angle estimation accuracy within 5–20 degrees.
  - Contributed to the Bentley PM Seats project and GP3 Smart Golf project.

- **China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd.** — Intern, Big Data Department, Jinan, China *(07/2024 – 08/2024)*
